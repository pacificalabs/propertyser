      <h5>12. Functionality</h5>
      The first main function of <%= t("business.name") %> is for Sellers of real estate to get feedback on their property and then market their real estate to prospective Buyers.
      As a Seller, if you register with <%= t("business.name") %> and list your property on the site, you are agreeing to pay the Success Fee to <%= t("business.name") %> upon successful sale of your property. The Seller or their solicitor is obligated to inform <%= t("business.name") %> when a successful sale occurs by way of introduction to the Buyer through this website. Successful sale means exchange of contracts between the Buyer and Seller. As a Seller, you should not list your property on this site if you do not intend to pay the Success Fee.
      The second main function of <%= t("business.name") %> is for Buyers to search for properties to buy via our search engine function. The Buyer can save their searches, and when a Buyer locates a property they are interested in, they can contact <%= t("business.name") %> to arrange an inspection. By way of making contact with <%= t("business.name") %> and requesting an inspection, the Buyer agrees to only inspect properties in good faith that the Buyer has a genuine interest in, and the ability to complete a purchase of said property. As a Buyer, if you do not have interest, intent or the ability to buy the property you are interested in, please do not make contact with <%= t("business.name") %> to arrange inspections or enter into negotiations.
      Sellers and Buyers do not enter into a binding agreement to sell and purchase the real estate on this site. If a Seller wishes to proceed with the Buyer, the Seller and the Buyer must enter into a contract for sale for the real estate outside of this site. A binding agreement will only be formed if the Buyer and Seller enter into a separate written contract for sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h5>13. Use of Photos</h5>
      When a Seller loads photos of their property on our website, they give <%= t("business.name") %> explicit permission to use these photos in our marketing & for the use of our carousel on our home page. All photos loaded become the property of <%= t("business.name") %>, & Sellers waive their rights to privacy in relation to these photos.
