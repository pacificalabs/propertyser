### RUBOCOP:
Pick up a cop with offenses in the .rubocop-todo.yml file.

Read the documentation at docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/1.36/index.html.

Check if the Cop supports Safe Autocorrection.

Check the default enforced style for the Cop. Check if the Style is shared across various languages. The reason for this is to bring consistency in development.
